# iCal [Community Edition] Plugin for Stream Deck

![Plugin Example](https://github.com/pedrofuentes/stream-deck-ical/blob/main/assets/plugin.gif)

iCal Plugin for [elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) that displays information from your calendar using an iCal URL. Visual cues and a countdown will help you end meetings on time and be ready for the next one. 

Original plugin by Pedro Fuentes hasn't received any updates since 2021, but the community has made some fixes and improvements. However, many people can't get a stable version of this plugin because the original one in the Elgato Market doesn't include these fixes. This build was created to help regular users access the plugin (and it really does its job now).

The original plugin is available on the Stream Deck store, but here you can download [the last release of Community Edition](https://github.com/goshabty/goshabty-stream-deck-ical-community-edition/releases/tag/prod) or build it yourself using the code on this repo.

## What`s inside ##
This version was built with several fixes and improvements from github community: 
* MSCRMGuru (recurring events fix, https://github.com/MSCRMGuru/stream-deck-ical)
* damirault (UX improvements, except "only busy events showing" https://github.com/damirault/stream-deck-ical)
